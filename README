 DESCRIPTION
 -----------
    AstroCTC (Astronomical CCD in Telescope Capture) is an application designed for 
    video and image capture of the Planets and the Moon. A suitable astronomical or
    modified webcam will give the best results, however it will work with most webcams.

    Numerous video and image formats are available, however FITS image support is
    mostly basic and should only be used by those familiar with it.

    AstroCTC is intended for use with Linux only.

    While AstroCTC is primarily designed for astronomical use, it can also serve as a general
    webcam program.

 BUILD FROM SOURCE
 -----------------
    If you wish to build and/or work on AstroCTC separately, the source is located at:

    	https://github.com/mr-headwind/AstroCTC

    Download the code package to a development directory and unpack
    	
    The GTK+ 3.0 and Gstreamer 1.0 libraries need to be installed and additionally the following
    may be required:
    	sudo apt-get install libv4l-dev
    	sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev
    	sudo apt-get install libpng-dev
    	See below for FITS details

    The icon image file 'astroctc.png' will need to be located appropriately:
    	mkdir -P .local/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps
    	mkdir -P .local/share/pixmaps/AstroCTC
    	ln -s astroctc.png .local/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps/astroctc.png
    	ln -s astroctc.png .local/share/pixmaps/AstroCTC/astroctc.png

 BUILD FITS FROM SOURCE
 ----------------------
    If you need to build the FITS libaray separately, the source and instructions are located at:

    	http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio

    Briefly, download the code package and do the following:
    	cd /usr/local/src
	mv ~/Downloads/cfitsio????.tar.gz .		(where ???? is the version, currently 3370)
	tar zxvf cfitsio????.tar.gz
	./configure --prefix=/usr
	make
	make install

 THINGS TO BE DONE
 -----------------
    Web page - check out Launch Pad or add 'not ready' message
    Set up GIT / Sourceforge
    Set up gmail account (astroctc@gmail.com)
    Install instructions (libraries, GTK, GST, Fits, set up desktop icon)
    Find out how to build a .deb package for apt-get install astroctc

 THINGS TO BE CHECKED OR REVIEWED
 --------------------------------

 KNOWN ISSUES / BUGS
 -------------------
    . On some computers and some cameras (and sometimes), changing the resolution of the video area will
      work the first time, but subsequent changes will be unpredictabe. The work-around is to
      select 'Camera' -> 'Restart Video' on the menu.
    . On some computers (probably where VAAPI is used) using 'autovideosink' will cause a core dump when
      the pipeline is closed and restarted. 'xvimagesink' and / or 'ximagesink' are used instead.
      A bug and test case have been submitted for this.
    . There is a problem using 'xvimagesink' and setting the Reticule on. The problem appears to be 
      after a 'return GST_PAD_PROBE_REMOVE;' probe command and will manifest with the message: 
      'libv4l2: error turning on stream: Invalid argument' (sometimes) and the video will freeze. 
      The work-around is to use 'ximagesink'. A bug and test case have been submitted for this.
    . There is a bug in Preferences window trying to select the capture directory. Cannot select 
      directory immediately. Need to shift selection a few times before 'Apply' is enabled.
    . There is a bug editing encoder property values as follows:-
      	 select cell, change value and click Save - value is lost unless cell selection is moved or user 
      	 hits enter first (Investigate using GtkEntry signal "preedit-changed" and  GtkEntryBuffer 
      	 signal "inserted-text").
    . There is an occasional error when AstroCTC is run for the first time in a session where the program 
      aborts with a core dump. This appears to be a problem with the driver and the camera not being ready.
      Running again usually works, but the transient nature makes this difficult to narrow down.
    . There is an issue using YUY2 in the video settings in combination with certain video capture
      formats (eg. YUY2/YUY2, YUY2/Ogg). This has only occurred with an ASUS built-in laptop camera,
      but there could possibly be others.
    . There is a problem with some resolution showing on the main window and taking snapshots where there
      is a delay. Some resolutions greater than 800 x 600 will show an image with lines. This seems to relate
      to the size of the drawing area.

 THE TECHNICAL STUFF
 -------------------
    AstroCTC has been developed in c and uses GTK+ 3.0 for user interfaces, GStreamer 1.0 for video
    handling functions and video4linux2 (v4l2) for snapshots and camera details. There are also a
    number of additional libraries required: cairo, png12, cfitsio, jpeg, pthread.

 BUGS & SUGGESTIONS
 ------------------
    Email any bugs, requests or suggestions to astroctc_AB@gmail.com

 ITEMS FOR IMPROVEMENT
 ---------------------
    . Stepwise operations for cameras that can handle them are not supported. (low prioity)
    . Sound is only an option if the camera (and driver) supports it. Could use sound card. (low priority)
    . Add facility to note/record telescope, conditions and location to any (optional) meta file
    . FITS support is very basic. Add ascii / binary tables with camera and other settings info. eg Title
    . Possibly change status information text at the bottom of the main window into a 
      GtkStatusBar. (low priority)
    . Only enable the Save button for presets (profiles) when the preset changes instead of 
      always enabled. This can be done but its quite messy (hint: pass the main ui pointer (m_ui)). 
      (low prioity)
    . For Night View, add a slider widget to allow the user to choose the degree of shading.
    . Add a facility to review recent snapshots as thumbnails and full view on selection. 
      On mouseover also show the 'meta' data (above). (low priority)
    . Investigate and include 'long exposure' options for cameras that support it.
    . Add a function on the Codec Properties window eg. an info. button or right button mouse click 
      to view a description of a particular property. Also the list a properties presented is not 
      exhaustive.
